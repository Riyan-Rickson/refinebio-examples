## Introduction to Microarray technology

Data analyses are generally not "one size fits all"; this is particularly true as we are working with different technologies. 
This tutorial has example analyses [organized by technology](../01-getting-started/getting-started.html#about-how-this-tutorial-book-is-structured) so you can follow examples that are more closely tailored to the nature of the data at hand. 

As with all experimental methods, microarray has strengths and limitations that you should consider in regards to your scientific questions. 

### Microarray data **strengths**:  

### Microarray data **limitations**:  

See here for more about the [quantile normalization process in refine.bio](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#quantile-normalization)

### More resources on microarray technology: 

#### Why doesn't the gene I care about show up in this dataset?

There can be a lot of reasons a particular gene might not show up in your refine.bio RNA-seq dataset, here are just a few reasons:  
  - The gene was not covered by the probset
